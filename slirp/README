The following patches correct issues in slirp. They are based on Debian's
slirp 1.0.17-3 (as distributed by Ubuntu), but should be easily applied
to similar versions, such as 1.0.17-4.

slirp-ppp-fakeip.patch:

    This patch corrects an issue where PPP does not work if the host's IP
    address is 127.0.1.1 or a similar loopback address. This patch causes
    SLiRP to identify over PPP as 10.0.2.0 (the SLiRP special address)
    instead.

slirp-cygwin-compat.patch:

    This patch corrects a compilation issue on Cygwin. SLiRP uses a macro
    called _P to support function prototypes. However, Cygwin's libc
    independently uses a macro called _P for the isalnum ... isxdigit
    functions in ctype.h. This patch renames SLiRP's _P macro to _PR.

    After applying this patch and configuring SLiRP, run 'make proclean'
    to remove the prototype cache files and ensure that the patch takes
    effect.
